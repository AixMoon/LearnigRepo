# LearningRepo

This is a repo that stores my codes and materials during my learning process of Software Engineering in ECNU.

There might be mistakes and I hope to learn from you all.

## /Course

Here's my homework files, mostly in class while some of them are sets of moocs.
#### CS:APP
Computer System: A Programming Pespective.

## /Draft

Some uncategorized files, demos or little programs for fun.

## /EOJ

Problems and contest solutions in EOJ(http://acm.ecnu.edu.cn).

## /temp

I created this directory to store the output files for VS Code.
It's messy there.
